I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Software Development.

In my past experiences, I had the guidance of [Alvin W.Y. Su](https://dblp.org/pid/37/2983.html) to delve into cutting-edge algorithms in reinforcement learning. Also, I was advised by [Jim Huang](https://github.com/jserv) to research the Linux kernel. Additionally, my internships at Mediatek and PAIA equipped me with practical insights into system software and backend development.

I am also a dedicated software engineer with a strong passion for solving software problems and contributing to open-source projects during my free time. For now, I am especially deeply interested in studying state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
